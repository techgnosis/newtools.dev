      <p>
        When my friends ask me what makes the Apple Watch useful it's hard to answer because there are so many small things. Here's a list of the best use cases I can think of, in no particular order:
        <ul>
          <li>Sleep tracking</li>
          <li>Spotify remote</li>
          <li>Download Spotify tracks to your watch so you can listen without your phone</li>
          <li>Red notification dot</li>
          <li>Stop or snooze alarms</li>
          <li>Find your phone around the house with the button that makes your phone make noise</li>
          <li>Easy access to Siri</li>
          <li>See the weather forecast at all times</li>
          <li>See the date at all times</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        The only thing you need to do to activate Sleep mode is enable the Sleep focus. You do not need a Sleep Schedule. Just activate the Sleep focus and the next time your watch face dims, it will "Sleep dim". If you don't have a regular sleep schedule then this is very useful, otherwise you are constantly screwing up your sleep tracking by starting too early or too late.

      <p>
        You can have a dedicated button to launch your favorite app. By default the side button (not the crown, the other button) shows you your most recent apps. But if you change it to Favorites, and then pick just one Favorite, then you have a dedicated button for an app. The only Favorite I have is Spotify, so I have a dedicated hardware Spotify button.

      <p>
        Put Battery on your watch face. I've found it very helpful to have Battery front-and-center instead of buried in the swipe-up menu.

      <p>
        Turn off "Start Workout Reminder" and "End Workout Reminder", otherwise the Workouts app will always be asking you if you want to start or end a Workout whenever you start walking somewhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        Switch your App View to "List". I don't know how anyone finds "Grid" useful.
