One of the many, many burdens that drugs and alcohol put on you is the inability to distinguish how you really feel because of all the variables at play. Here are some variables off the top of my head - 
* are you drunk or high?
* are you hungover?
* are you sobering up?
* are you still recovering from a hangover (it takes many days)?
* are you lacking quality sleep because you slept drunk or high?
* are you distracted thinking about how much you want to be drunk or high right now? 

When you spend all your time getting drunk or high you can never get to the "core" of you and determine what you actually feel. It's always the alcohol talking, or its always the THC talking, or whatever. Did you blow up on your friend because you were actually that angry, or do you feel angry because you are jonesing? Or are you angry because you are coming down? Maybe you got angry because you were drunker than you thought you were. Did you really want to go on that group vacation or did you just say yes because you were drunk? The list goes on and on. But like most problems, this one has a solution. Sobriety. Eliminate all of those variables and get to know yourself for the first time.
