Sports events without alcohol are a breeze. There are countless ways that sports are made worse with alcohol -
* Having to get up to pee
* Spending between 13 and 19 dollars per drink
* Having to pee while you struggle to get home because the crowds leaving the game are insane and the train will take forever

Without alcohol you spend less while you're there and you can take the bus or the train home because you aren't in a huge rush
