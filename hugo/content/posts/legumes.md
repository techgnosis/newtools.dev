Legumes really are amazing. Not only are they [sustainable](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/1/98) but they are nutritious and provide enough protein for healthy muscle mass. Corn is not sustainable, not nutritious, and does not provide protein.

Legumes are also good survival food in times of crisis. They are cheap, they store easily, and they can grow most anywhere.

It also helps that they are delicious.
