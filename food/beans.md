Dry lentils absorb more liquid when cooking than soaked beans.


## soaking
Beans (except lentils) need to soak in water to soften up before you cook them. Soak the beans in salty water. The water should taste like the ocean.

## cooking
Why reach for a measuring cup? 1 ml of water weighs 1g. 1 cup is ~236ml.

Add a bouillon cube to the water or use broth.
