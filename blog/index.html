	Legumes really are amazing. Not only are they sustainable but they are nutritious and provide enough protein for healthy muscle mass. Corn is not sustainable, not nutritious, and does not provide protein.
Legumes are also good survival food in times of crisis. They are cheap, they store easily, and they can grow most anywhere.
It also helps that they are delicious.&hellip;

	Sports events without alcohol are a breeze. There are countless ways that sports are made worse with alcohol -
Having to get up to pee Spending between 13 and 19 dollars per drink Having to pee while you struggle to get home because the crowds leaving the game are insane and the train will take forever Without alcohol you spend less while you&rsquo;re there and you can take the bus or the train home because you aren&rsquo;t in a huge rush&hellip;

	One of the many, many burdens that drugs and alcohol put on you is the inability to distinguish how you really feel because of all the variables at play. Here are some variables off the top of my head -
are you drunk or high? are you hungover? are you sobering up? are you still recovering from a hangover (it takes many days)? are you lacking quality sleep because you slept drunk or high?&hellip;
