      <h1>Essentials</h1>

      <p>
        These are the tools I use every day. Some of them are modern replacements for classic tools (ripgrep replaces grep, fd replaces find, etc..) and
        some are just essential.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/micro">micro</a><br>
        A terminal editor that works like you would hope it works. Ctrl+S for save, Ctrl+C/V for copy/paste, Ctrl+Q for
        quit. Home and End work. Even mouse support.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a><br> Like grep but with easier defaults. Ripgrep by
        default searches the directory you are in recursively.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all">ripgrep-all</a><br>
        Wraps ripgrep and allows you to search tar.gz and other interesting formats
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd"> fd </a><br>Like find but with easier defaults. By default searches your
        current directory recursively. You can also add an .fdignore file to make it ignore certain directories.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/chmln/sd">sd </a><br> Like sed but easier to use. Works as expected instead of like
        a
        Kafka-esque nightmare.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat</a><br>
        Like cat but it highlights and formats and many other things
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert">mkcert</a><br>
        Create a local CA for your dev environment. The CA is installed in all your browsers and your OS-level trust
        store, which means you can make certs that are not treated as self-signed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/starship/starship">starship</a><br>
        Smart prompt. Single config applies to any supported shell.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/denisidoro/navi">navi</a><br>
        TUI cheatsheet. Write custom files full of commands and then get a nice TUI interface to select them. Powered by
        fzf.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/wagoodman/dive">dive</a><br>
        By far the best tool for exploring the contents of an OCI image
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/paxtonhare/demo-magic">Demo Magic</a><br>
        Great tool for driving terminal-focused demos. Never type live or hide complex commands in scripts again!
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/schollz/croc">croc</a><br>
        Simple CLI to send files to another machine on the same network. Exactly as easy as it should be.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/restic/restic">restic</a><br>
        Simple and fast snapshot-based backup tool. Single dependency-free binary powered by environment variables.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>K8s essentials</h1>
      
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/corneliusweig/ketall">ketall</a><br>
        Actually "get all" from kubectl, instead of the pretend "get all" it does now.
      </p>
      
       <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/derailed/k9s">k9s</a><br>
        Great TUI for looking at a K8s cluster
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/">cert-manager</a><br>
        Self-service TLS certs powered by K8s resources. Hooks up to Vault and Venafi for enterprise users
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io"/>kind</a>or 
        <a href="https://github.com/rancher/k3d">k3d</a>or 
        <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube">minikube</a><br>
        A lightweight way to run K8s on your laptop. All three tools build clusters inside Docker.
     </p>
      
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h1>Language Tools</h1>
      
      <p>
        Tools focused on specific languages or perhaps just coding in general
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a><br>
        Decouples the language support from the editor. Prevents only certain editors from being the best at a particular language
        and instead allows editors to focus on text editing features.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer">rust-analyzer</a><br>
        Rust had one of the first language servers, rls. rust-analyzer is the gen2 version of rls and does not rely on code compilation
        to learn about your code.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/golang/vscode-go#language-server">gopls</a><br>
        Go also has a language server. Its functionality replaces the collection of CLI tools that the VS Code extension relies
        on by default. Despite being in alpha the docs say "gopls is recommended for projects that use Go modules."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer">PyOxidizer</a><br>
        Turn your Python project into a single executable. Can be a static executable if you want to link against musl. PyOxidizer itself is a Rust
        project.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <a href="https://deno.land/">Deno</a><br>
        TypeScript runtime in a single executable. Can create single executables out of your TypeScript, like PyOxidizer above. Simplify distribution
        whether to end users or servers.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a><br>
        Some say its the actual new C, instead of Rust. Zig is self-described as "better at using C libraries than C is at using C libraries."
        Simple language with build tools and cross-compilation included. Zig has a language server that follows the LSP as discussed a few posts above.

      <h1>Investing</h1>
      My personal preference is to invest in Closed End Funds (CEFs) for a variety of reasons. This section doesn't have to be limited to CEFs though.
